Hi! My name is Jen and I am a Ph.D. student in machine learning at IST Austria,
advised by [Dr. Dan Alistarh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alistarh/){:target="_blank"}.
I was also fortunate to intern with Weiwei Yang and Janardhan Kulkani at Microsoft Research.

I am primarily interested in the practical and theoretical foundations of
applying machine learning and deep learning models in
real-life--specifically, questions of efficiency, fairness, bias, and general model
interpretability. I study these specifically in the context of
edge-device deployment and other constrained-resource environments.

Before starting at IST, I spent some time in industry: I traded equity
options on Wall Street, taught math and science to high-school students
in San Francisco, helped build a healthcare startup, and built and deployed deep learning models for text
recognition at Google LA.

I am a community lead at [Cohere for AI](https://cohere.com/research){:target="_blank"}, where I host talks on using ML for social good.
